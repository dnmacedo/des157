        <p>This is a sticker of the mascot for GitHub. It's also my mascot for my pursuits of
          knowledge in web design, and it keeps me going and learning new things.
          When I look at it, I think of being in my Dad's truck listening to "Honkey Cat"
          by Elton John on his radio. This one's for you, OctoCat.</p>

        <p>I collect vynils and this is one of my favorite albums. My Uncle gave it to me when
          he found out I got my first record player. "Rumors" by Fleetwood Mac
          was one of their best albums, and today many collectors deem it
          a valuable find. The song playing is "Never Going Back Again," which
          happens to be one of my favorite by them.

        <p>You found my ring! I got this from my Aunt when I graduated middle school. She knew
          that peace signs were my favorite symbol. I've been wearing it ever since I got it in 2008.
          I have never misplaced it and you can usually find it on my right ring finger. "Imagine" by
          John Lennon, although well known, describes a dream I too have always had for the world.

        <p>This is a tambourine that you can attach to your foot. I saw another guitarist
          playing with it and so I got one at Watermelon Music store in Davis. It brings back nostalgic memories
          of playing guitar in the freshman dorms with my two best friends. They brought a guitar and
          a ukelele and we would play songs together almost every weekend. "Lost in My Mind" by
          The Head and the Heart was not an unusual song for us to play.

        <p>This is one of my favorite sleep shirts. An album by Pink Floyd, "Dark side of the Moon,"
          includes a clear prism and display of light splitting into rainbow colors-- a classic symbol for the band.
          Mostly this shirt makes me think of when I was driving with my Dad and him
          explaining the meaning of their song, "Mother." It's about an overprotective and
          skeptical mother sheltering her child, and as a result, the child finds mother building
          a wall, "the wall," to protect him, from girlfriends, from the government, from the
          world.
