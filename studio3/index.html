        <p>This is the mascot for GitHub. It's my mascot for my pursuits of
          knowledge in web design, and keeps me going</p>

      <div id="recordInfo">
        <img src="pngs/recordInfo.png" alt="Fleetwood Mac record" width="200">
        <p>This is one of my favorite albums. My Uncle gave it to me when
          he found out I got my first record player. "Rumors" by Fleetwood Mac
          was one of their best albums, and today many collectors deem it
          a valuable find!

        <img src="pngs/ringInfo.png" alt="silver peace sign ring" width="200">
        <p>Wow! You found my ring! I got this from my Aunt when I graduated middle school. She knew
          that peace signs were my favorite symbol. I've been wearing it ever since I got it in 2008!
          I have never misplaced it and you can usually find it on my right ring finger.

      <!-- info for tambourine -->
      <div id="tambInfo">
        <img src="pngs/tambInfo.png" alt="foot tambourine" width="200">
        <p>This is a tambourine that you can attach to your foot! It brings back nostalgic memories
          of playing guitar in the freshman dorms with my two best friends. They brough a guitar and
          a ukelele and we would play songs together almost every weekend.

      <div id="shirtInfo">
        <img src="pngs/shirtInfo.png" alt="Pink Floyd T-shirt for 'Darkside of the moon'" width="200">
        <p>This is one of my favorite sleep shirts. "The Darkside of the Moon," an album by Pink Floyd,
          includes a clear prism and display of light splitting into rainbow colors. This depiction of
          the phenomenon is a classic symbol for the band. Mostly this shirt makes me think of my
          strong attachment to my dad's music taste. "Mother" is my favorite song by them.
