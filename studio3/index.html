        <p>This is a sticker of the mascot for GitHub. It's my mascot for my pursuits of
          knowledge in web design, and keeps me going. I dedicate "Honkey Cat"
          by Elton John to GitHub Octocat, for being my right hand for web
          design projects.</p>

        <p>This is one of my favorite albums. My Uncle gave it to me when
          he found out I got my first record player. "Rumors" by Fleetwood Mac
          was one of their best albums, and today many collectors deem it
          a valuable find! The song playing is "Never Going Back Again."

        <p>Wow! You found my ring! I got this from my Aunt when I graduated middle school. She knew
          that peace signs were my favorite symbol. I've been wearing it ever since I got it in 2008!
          I have never misplaced it and you can usually find it on my right ring finger. "Imagine" by
          John Lennon, although well known, describes a dream I too have for the world someday.

        <p>This is a tambourine that you can attach to your foot! It brings back nostalgic memories
          of playing guitar in the freshman dorms with my two best friends. They brought a guitar and
          a ukelele and we would play songs together almost every weekend. "Lost in My Mind" by
          The Head and the Heart was not an unusual song for us to play.

        <p>This is one of my favorite sleep shirts. An album by Pink Floyd, "Dark side of the Moon,"
          includes a clear prism and display of light splitting into rainbow colors-- a classic symbol for the band.
          Mostly this shirt makes me think of my
          strong attachment to my dad's music taste. "Wish you were here" is my favorite song.
