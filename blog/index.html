        <h2>Don't Make Me Think: Needless Words</h2>

        <h4>03/02/17</h4>

        <img src="images/presentation.png" width="600" alt="screenshot of ideas by Krug">

        <p>Chapter 5 in "Don't Make Me Think- revisited" by Steve Krug is mainly
          about getting rid of those needless words on your
          webpage for efficiency. Needless words come in a variety of forms and
          are simply glazed over and take up space. There are two kinds of needless
          words that this chapter talks about and one is “happy talk”. These kinds
          of words are the ones that talk up what the reader is already visiting;
          in so many words, happy talk is in so many words basically saying,
          “this is why what your visiting is so great” instead of what makes it
          so great in fewer words or no words at all. The next kind of needless
          words are instructions. Instructions are needless partly because the
          interface should be straightforward and shouldn’t need instructions of
          how to navigate the site. And even then, people will not want to read
          a block of text if they don’t deem it important, thus it drives them
          away. Keeping the most important instructions that the human user might
          find valuable should be included but kept at a minimum. Krug says that
          his own motto is to cut down words by half, which might be why his
          chapter is so short! <br> <br>I agree with many things he says here, because I
          am a person that is guilty of putting in fluffy words. I think that
          when a person comes to a website, they are already knowing what they
          want to find and the less obstructions to that (like needless words)
          the better. Interface should speak for itself and be self-explanatory
          in how it works. I myself have a bit of happy talk in the intros of my
          portfolio sections, so I will be sure to take Krug’s words to heart and
          try to cut down my content to a bare minimum and let my work speak for itself.
          <br><br>

          <p>Here's how <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/style/writing.html">Google</a> tries to omit needless words.</p>

        <h2>Meet Me at the Library</h2>

        <h4>02/21/17</h4>

        <img src="images/studio5.png" width="600" alt="screenshot of my self-built website">

        <p>For the fifth studio, I learned about the library Velocity.js. Most of my difficulty
          came from getting the library to work in my code. Syntax was quite the challenge,
          but I learned that there's another way to write the code without jQuery. So,
          I removed the "$" in front of each of my functions, and used the traditional syntax,
          which solved my problem. After that, getting Velocity to do what I wanted it to do
          was not too bad. I learned that you can put transitions that change the CSS and you
          can label the duration it would take. This gave me dynamic animations laid out simply
          in my code. Overall, I enjoyed acquiring Velocity to my project. <br><br>
          Go to the <a href="http://velocityjs.org/">Velocity.js library</a>

        <h2>Time Is on My Side</h2>

        <h4>02/14/17</h4>

        <img src="images/studio4.png" width="600" alt="screenshot of my self-built website">

        <p>This project was pretty fun, however I faced much difficulty with
          getting it to be interestingly interactive. I made it as a demo of
          how time is uni-directional. Once you scramble and cook and egg, there's
          no going back! It's a fun way to demonstrate a simple law of physics,
          and I feel it fits within the given topic.

        <h2>Pocket Full of Interface</h2>

        <h4>02/07/17</h4>

        <img src="images/studio3.png" width="600" alt="screenshot of my self-built website">

        <p>In my first attempt at UX/UI in this interactive design, I think
          certain features bring this site to life. I have a still image of
          a space in my room, and certain items can be clicked on for more info.
          I think this is a good experiential design because it's putting my
          audience right into my room, as if they were picking up the objects
          themselves. I added an extra audio player element to add to this
          experience; the player plays my favorite song on the record that's
          sitting on the record player. Now they have not only visual but audio
          experience. Lastly, I think that by making them highlight as the objects
          are hovered over has always been something I wanted to see in "find it"
          games like ISPY. This helps the audience navigate and find the objects
          they need to with ease.

        <h2>User interface critique: Canvas</h2>

        <h4>01/31/17</h4>

        <img src="images/canvas.png" width="600" alt="screenshot of canvas dashboard">

        <p>Looking at the canvas website for teachers and students, I would first
          say that the colors are very attractive and the overall design is
          pleasing to the eye. One thing I would change is the vertical nav bar,
          which I think could have a bit more width. Through the lens of Bill
          DeRouchey's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">Learning IxD From Everyday Objects</a>,
          the heirarchy is not
          bad on canvas. Actions and headings are separated by spaces to attain group
          and individual heirarchy that gives the page an overall cleanliness.
          For clarity, the website uses symbols and colors to organize all the
          different pathways you could take on the site. Lastly for purpose, canvas
          maintains its essence by providing sections based on what students are
          going to want to look for regarding their classes; calendar, courses,
          assignments due soon, and notificaitons on graded materials are what
          students look for when navigating a website in this educational genre. I would
          say that canvas is a unique design that, with practice, can be quite
          user friendly. However, there are numerous pathways to get to the same things
          sometimes, which might result in confusion for the user.

        <h2>User interface critique: Atom</h2>
        <h4>01/12/17</h4>

        <img src="images/atom.jpg" width="600" alt="screenshot of facebook">

        <p>Atom is a program I use often in my web development projects. Its
          interface is so successful in that it allows me to get projects done in
          the quickest time possible. Its background is a dark color- and by no
          accident. I really appreciate the clear yet mild contrast of the
          background and the characters. The makers of atom know that coders
          work long hours programming, and often times in the evening when the
          brain is buzzing and calculating ideas. Another great feature of atom
          is the color coded style format. This was very helpful for me as a
          novice coder. All in all, the user interface of Atom is unbeatable
          when it comes to practicing code successfully.
