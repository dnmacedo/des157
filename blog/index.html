        <p>Looking at the canvas website for teachers and students, I would first
          say that the colors are very attractive and the overall design is
          pleasing to the eye. One thing I would change is the vertical nav bar,
          which I think could have a bit more width. Through the lens of Bill
          DeRouchey's "Learning IxD From Everyday Objects," the heirarchy is not
          bad on canvas. Actions and headings are separated by spaces to attain group
          and individual heirarchy that gives the page an overall cleanliness.
          For clarity, the website uses symbols and colors to organize all the
          different pathways you could take on the site. Lastly for purpose, canvas
          maintains its essence by providing sections based on what students are
          going to want to look for regarding their classes; calendar, courses,
          assignments due soon, and notificaitons on graded materials are what
          students look for when navigating a website in this educational genre. I would
          say that canvas is a unique design that, with practice, can be quite
          user friendly. However, there are numerous pathways to get to the same things
          sometimes, which might result in confusion for the user.

        <h2>User interface critique: Atom</h2>
        <h4>01/12/17</h4>

        <img src="images/atom.jpg" width="600" alt="screenshot of facebook">

        <p>Atom is a program I use often in my web development projects. Its
          interface is so successful in that it allows me to get projects done in
          the quickest time possible. Its background is a dark color- and by no
          accident. I really appreciate the clear yet mild contrast of the
          background and the characters. The makers of atom know that coders
          work long hours programming, and often times in the evening when the
          brain is buzzing and calculating ideas. Another great feature of atom
          is the color coded style format. This was very helpful for me as a
          novice coder. All in all, the user interface of Atom is unbeatable
          when it comes to practicing code successfully.
