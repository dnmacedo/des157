# Student Template for DES157

This is a portal to a series of small projects as well as the beginnings of a large project for a web development course. Organized by textbook exercises, studio practice and the process of creating our final project based on an idea we came up with for the ISEA Conference of 2017. https://dnmacedo.github.io/des157/
