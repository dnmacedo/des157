      <h1>Topic Choice</h1>
      
      <p id="topic">My choice of topic for the ISEA confrence is "peace within- finding
        inner peace." My project will be a service that may be a digital interface
        or physical, which will help people set goals for themselves and achieve
        those goals in every day life. My audience is primarily focused on
        individuals of any age that hope to minimize anxiety in their everyday
        life. I would like this project to not be something only people with
        a smartphone could use. It'll take time, but I am hoping that it will
        motivate and satisfy the needs of my particular audience. Perhaps I could
        cater it to a specific culture that would be unlikely candidates, such
        as indiginous groups of people. I haven't decided yet if I am going to
        be all-inclusive, or cater empathetically to one culture. But it seems
        my idea would be hard to cater outside the modern worlds. Still in
        progress!
