      <h1>Topic Choice</h1>

      <p id="topic">My choice of topic for the ISEA confrence is creating an
        interface that can help people who are multilingual acquire the daily
        quirks of English. I also want to cover basic English skills through
        a series of games that could be beneficial for people of any English
        proficiency. In my project I hope that it will help people who are
        multilingual feel more connected and adapted to living in a diverse
        country like the US.
