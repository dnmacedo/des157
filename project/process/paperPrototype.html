  <h2>Prototype #1</h2>

  <p>For this first paper prototype of my project, I made a concptual version
    of what I thought my interface might look like. The first person I shared
    it with was having some difficulty with the task. I'm not sure if they
    didn't understand the instructions or if my interface was difficult to
    follow, but making my second, I figured it was the former. Once my person
    got the hang of my paper prototype, they reported that it was pretty
    straightforward and was simply wondering how I would code it all. That is
    a good question to keep in mind from here on out. I made some changes and went
    onto my second version of the paper prototype.

  <h2>Prototype #2</h2>

  <p>The second prototype I created had some changes. I made buttons look more like
    buttons by outlining them or drawing them more accurately. I also provided
    drop down menus for things that would be drop downs. The second person that
    looked at my prototype found that my project was pretty straightforward as
    well, but offered that maybe it should have more sections/topics to cover
    more information. I think from here I need to focus on making things look
    more clickable, that is the biggest thing I got out of this project.
    Improving the ease of interactivity and minimizing instruction, considering
    my audience won't have English as their first language.
