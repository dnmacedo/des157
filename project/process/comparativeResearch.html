      <h1>Comparative Research</h1>

      <p>My idea that I am comparing these websites to is a planning tool for
        the mobile device that not only helps you plan and organize tasks,
        but also helps to minimize stress and anxiety of busy people. I want to
        motivate people to set goals for themselves and practice time management
        so that they can lead their lives with less stress. I downloaded and tested
        out these two apps for myself to get an idea of what's already out there.

      <h2>Planner Pro</h2>

      <p>This application is visually very appealing. The interface is mostly uncolored
        except for the spot color in the head and action buttons. It is pretty
        straight forward in usage; it shows a monthly calendar and you may swipe to
        the left to jot down notes or to the right to look at your list of tasks.
        Making a task is pretty quick; it has a fill in option reading "I want to..."
        and from there you set yourself a time when you want to be reminded. These
        tasks can be organized by "Today" or "Due Soon" showing 0/1 tasks have been
        completed for example, or that 1 is due soon.<br> <br>What I don't really like about
        this particular application is that it is missing this emotional aspect I
        want to incorporate for my project. There's not alot of reward when completing
        a task. Honestly, it's not very different from the default calendar app that
        comes with people's phones. There's an interesting "projects" section that
        I wasn't able to explore without paying $5 a month, but it seemed to be that
        one thing that made it better than a mobile phone's prewired calendar.

      <h2>Any.do</h2>

      <p>This app definitely sets itself apart from the calendar style that I was
        criticising in the previous example. This app feels much more personal. The
        main menu says hi to me, I see clear categories of my to-dos in groceries, work,
        personal and all together. The next part that makes this app so interesting
        is when you go to a category, you see your list of tasks. If you order them
        by date, you see items organized by "today", "tomorrow", "upcoming", and
        "someday". I love that last added section called "someday", because people
        can also take note of their long term goals, which is the whole point of all
        the little immediate goals.<br> <br>Also, the coolest feature on
        this application is the "Any.do Moment". This feature goes through each task, one
        by one that you have lined up for today, and it asks you if you have completed it,
        want to remove it or postpone it. It really is a way to encourage the user
        to check back in on goals and be flexible with them. After all the tasks are gone through,
        it'll have a message like "Don't forget to smile!" I love this feature the most, because it
        connects with the user emotionally and is directed to likely the same audience
        I'm interested in.
