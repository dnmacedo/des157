      <h1>ISEA Proposal Draft: Artist Talk/Work in Progress</h1>

      <p id="proposal">My project for the ISEA Conference involves an interface of games that
        help multilinguals pick up the many quirks of English. I got the idea
        from an article that I read for a psychology class that I am currently
        taking. My class is language and cognition, and the paper I read had to
        do with comprehension and speech production in bilinguals vs monolinguals.
        This paper motivated me to explore the difficulties bilinguals face with
        their second language: specifically English. In the paper I learned that
        depending on how bilinguals were raised in early life, (being exposed to
        English speech or not before school teaching) it could tell a lot about
        the proficiency of people who are bilingual later in life. So I wanted
        to try and teach those quirks in English, even to people who didnâ€™t get
        the chance to be exposed to it when they were little, and enrich their
        English speaking/writing/reading experience.<br><br>
        The idea of the interface I will make will be comprised of different
        categories of games that focus on different areas in English where
        frustrating quirks come up. Within those categories there will be one
        or more games for people to interact with to help themselves pick up
        and notice these quirks better. For example, I want to do a simple phoneme
        game, where it teaches people who are bilingual how to differentiate
        the sounds in hearing and in speech production. Phonemes, or small pieces
        of whole speech sounds, can be anatomically similar to one another in
        speech production, like /g/ and /k/. The goal of this game is to help
        multilinguals differentiate between the sounds when hearing it, and also
        try practicing it on their own.<br><br>
        I have many more games in mind to explore different topics and features
        of the complex English language.
