      <h1>Background Research</h1>

      <p>My topic that I did background research on is the daily struggles that
        bilinguals face in their life. Often times there are many stereotypes
        about people who are bilingual. Monolingual people tend to glorify people
        with bilingualism because of their multidisciplinary abilities. They
        think that bilinguals can understand other foreign languages across the
        board better than monolinguals. The truth is, bilinguals do possess some
        higher cognitive capabilities, but in reality they share similar struggles
        regarding their second language or transitioning between their second
        language and native tongue, no matter their proficiency.

      <h2>New perspectives</h2>

      <p>One source I pulled from to examine struggles of people who are bilingual
        is a light-hearted, yet telling article by BuzzFeed called “21 Everyday
        Frustrations Bilinguals Will Understand.” This funny article contains gifs
        to express the extent of frustration that bilinguals could relate to in a
        number of different scenarios. There are a few of these scenarios that stuck
        out to me. Bilinguals are often thought to have incredible translation
        capabilities. People expect them to take and English word and return the
        alternative word for it in another language. The truth is, many words
        across languages do not translate to each other. This can cause many
        communication issues and language barriers that are at no fault to the
        bilingual person. Another struggle that stood out to me is the process
        that it takes to think of how to translate their thoughts to their second
        language. Often times this slows the flow of conversation and ideas may
        come out choppy or incomplete. One last one that I never thought of but
        makes sense are idioms. Even English speakers don’t always know what
        these mean, so I could understand why “let the cat out of the bag” or
        “spilt the beans” wouldn’t make sense to a person who is bilingual.
        At that point, bilinguals would have to learn them the way English
        speakers learn them—by just accepting them for what they are, not
        trying to make sense of it.<br>

        <br>Another source of research came from two individuals I held small
        interviews with in their struggles with being bilingual in everyday life.
        Both individuals speak Mandirin and their second language is English.
        Both shared some struggles while also expressing different difficulties
        with bilingualism. They both reported difficulty in “higher vocab”, words
        and phrases that seem to be more advanced than basic ones such as when
        speaking formally to a teacher or presenting to a class. This makes sense
        of course, that even native English speakers learn more advance vocab even
        after they are fluent. So words that do not seem too advanced such as
        “deliberately” may come to be of some difficulty for people who are bilingual.
        Interestingly though, social norms/phrases also seem to be a difficulty
        as well. What native English speakers might consider “that’s so bomb” to
        be an easily acquired phrase, the translation may not make any sense to
        bilinguals. Speaking of not making sense, idioms also seem to be problematic
        for these individuals, such as “spill the beans”. Although these two
        students differed in some difficulties with one another, for example one
        of them didn’t express many struggles with English simply because he
        reports that he doesn’t use it often. So this too plays a factor.<br>

        <br>I will continue to do research with more bilinguals and with multiple
        languages to get a better all around feel of what makes them tick about
        the English language as their second language.
