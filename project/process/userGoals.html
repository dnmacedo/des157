    <h1>User Goals</h1>

    <ul>
      <p>The humans will understand the content of the project because
      it will be clear as soon as they open the interface. First by
      starting with the icon/logo for the application should be
      pretty clear on what the app does.<br><br>
      Humans will understand the primary objectives through an easily
      navigable interface. It should be easy to get around and make
      sense upon first opening it.<br><br>
      The users need a score counter to encourage their learning and
      make the games fun. The humans need to be able to go back and
      fortha and exit when they like. They need clarity in the form
      of straigtforward graphics and minimal instruction.<br><br>
      My human audience would expect my project to be as a game
      and their experience level would be well experienced
      with apps that mine branches off of.</p>
